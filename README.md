# City Growth Analysis & Machine Learning

## Objective
Analyze city-level growth indicators such as population, job postings, colleges, skill centers, green cover, and internet penetration to understand development patterns and predict growth trends.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling for growth prediction

## Key Insights
- Relationship between education, jobs, and population growth
- Impact of infrastructure indicators on development
- Data-driven trends across cities

## Key Learnings
- Working with multi-feature structured datasets
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Predictive modeling for real-world planning problems

## Files
- city_growth_analysis.ipynb

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab and execute cells sequentially.
